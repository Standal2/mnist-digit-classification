# mnist-digit-classification
My exam project using machine learning to classify MNIST digits.

This project classifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset in CSV format.  
It was originally developed as an exam project in Applied Machine Learning.

The model is trained on labeled image data (28x28 pixels flattened to 784 columns), and predicts digits from 0 to 9.

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[MNIST in CSV â€“ by oddrationale](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/data)

To run this project, download the following files:
- `mnist_train.csv`
- `mnist_test.csv`

The dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limitations.
